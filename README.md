This repository is designed and rewrote based on [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-design-patterns/)

Design Patterns in Python are communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context

Software design are general, reusable solutions to common problems that arise during the design and development of software

## What are Design Patterns?

A design pattern is a generic repeatable solution to a frequently occuring problem in software design

It is not a complete design that can be written in code right away

It is a description or model for problem-solving that may be applied in a variety of contexts
