    "The Prototype Method Design Pattern in Python enables the creation of new objects by cloning existing ones, promoting efficient object creation and reducing overhead. \n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is particularly useful when the cost of creating a new object is high and when an object’s initial state or configuration is complex.\n",

    "By utilizing cloning, developers can streamline object creation, ensuring that new instances are created with the same properties and behaviors as the prototype, while also allowing for easy customization and modification.\n",

    "1. Prototype Interface or Abstract Class\n",
    "    - The Prototype Interface or Abstract Class declares the method(s) for cloning an object. \n",
    "    - It defines the common interface that concrete prototypes must implement, ensuring that all prototypes can be cloned in a consistent manner.\n",
    "    - The main role is to provide a blueprint for creating new objects by specifying the cloning contract.\n",
    "    - It declares the clone method, which concrete prototypes implement to produce copies of themselves.\n",
    "2. Concrete Prototype\n",
    "    - The Concrete Prototype is a class that implements the prototype interface or extends the abstract class. \n",
    "    - It’s the class representing a specific type of object that you want to clone.\n",
    "    - It defines the details of how the cloning process should be carried out for instances of that class.\n",
    "    - Implements the clone method declared in the prototype interface, providing the cloning logic specific to the class.\n",
    "3. Client\n",
    "    - The Client is the code or module that requests the creation of new objects by interacting with the prototype. It initiates the cloning process without being aware of the concrete classes involved.\n",
    "4. Clone Method\n",
    "    - The Clone Method is declared in the prototype interface or abstract class. \n",
    "    - It specifies how an object should be copied or cloned. \n",
    "    - Concrete prototypes implement this method to define their unique cloning behavior. It Describes how the object’s internal state should be duplicated to create a new, independent instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When to use the Prototype Design Pattern \n",
    "    - Creating Objects is Costly:\n",
    "        - Use the Prototype pattern when creating objects is more expensive or complex than copying existing ones.\n",
    "        - If object creation involves significant resources, such as database or network calls, and you have a similar object available, cloning can be more efficient.\n",
    "    - Variations of Objects:\n",
    "        - Use the Prototype pattern when your system needs to support a variety of objects with slight variations.\n",
    "        - Instead of creating multiple classes for each variation, you can create prototypes and clone them with modifications.\n",
    "    - Dynamic Configuration:\n",
    "        - Use the Prototype pattern when your system requires dynamic configuration and you want to create objects with configurations at runtime.\n",
    "        - You can prototype a base configuration and clone it, adjusting the properties as needed.\n",
    "    - Reducing Initialization Overhead:\n",
    "        - Use the Prototype pattern when you want to reduce the overhead of initializing an object.\n",
    "        - Creating a clone can be faster than creating an object from scratch, especially when the initialization process is resource-intensive."
